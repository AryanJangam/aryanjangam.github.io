I am Aryan, a final year student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Mumbai University. My journey is guided by an insatiable curiosity, and I am on a quest to seek and acquire profound wisdom in the realm of technology and science. Much like a seasoned explorer, I thrive on delving into the depths of knowledge, fueled by an unquenchable thirst for understanding the intricacies of the digital world.

When I'm not immersed in the world of academia, I embrace the realms of gaming and literature. Computer games transport me to virtual universes, where I can challenge my mind and reflexes, and books are my cherished companions, offering solace and enlightenment in equal measure during moments of respite.

I invite you to accompany me on this thrilling adventure of knowledge, where we will journey through the ever-evolving landscape of technology and science, exploring the uncharted territories of innovation, and unraveling the mysteries of the digital universe. Together, we shall forge a path towards enlightenment and uncover the treasures of wisdom that lie in the world of bytes and books alike.

As a software engineer, I've had the privilege of working on a diverse array of projects, each a testament to my passion for innovation and problem-solving. Here are a few highlights from my portfolio:

1. **Wanderlust**: This project exemplifies the fusion of technology and travel. Wanderlust is an AI-based travel itinerary planner, offering users a seamless experience for planning their adventures. It goes beyond traditional travel planning by providing personalized suggestions and recommendations, making it more than just an itinerary planner.

2. **Live Weather Website**: In this project, I harnessed the power of real-time data by developing a dynamic weather website using Node.js. It offers users the most up-to-date weather information, ensuring they are always prepared for whatever Mother Nature has in store.

3. **Eventer Application**: My foray into mobile app development led to the creation of Eventer. It's a user-friendly application designed to keep college students in the loop about upcoming events. With notification features, it ensures that no event goes unnoticed.

4. **Magazine Website**: I ventured into content creation with the development of an online magazine website. This platform provides a rich tapestry of articles, spanning diverse topics and categories, catering to a wide range of readers with varying interests.

5. **Jobseekers**: In an effort to help job seekers navigate the daunting job market, I developed a website that offers comprehensive company information, job listings, work experience insights, and interview preparation resources. It's a valuable resource for those embarking on their career journey.

These projects are a testament to my commitment to leveraging technology for various purposes, be it for travel, information dissemination, weather updates, or career development. I'm always eager to explore new challenges and contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape.
I have also been interested in the field of Machine Learning and AI and have started to learn it recently.
